# Ansible

##Can you speed up your roles with:


- Turn of host_key_checking for stable and secure environment:
```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```


- SSH multiplexing:

The first thing to check is whether the SSH connection reâ€“use works. Since Ansible performs all actions via SSH, any delay in establishing a connection significantly slows down the execution of the playbook as a whole.
In the ansible.cfg add:
```
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
```
Check: ```ansible test -vvvv -m ping``` You should see: ```SSH: EXEC ssh -vvv -C -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s ... -o ControlPath=/home/ubuntu/.ansible/cp/7c223265ce```


- Enable Pipeling:
```
[ssh_connection]
pipelining = true
```
Check: ```ansible test -vvv -m ping``` You should see ONE ssh call. Not a few.

- Turn of gather_facts:
```gather_facts: no```

- Place the ansible master in the environment closest to the target hosts. For example in the same AWS region.
